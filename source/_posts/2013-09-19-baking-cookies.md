## Day 1

So I found this game called Cookie Clicker one day. What a great idea. You click a cookie to get more cookies. You can use these new cookies to buy things that help you make more cookies and make them faster. When you buy these new things to make cookies faster, you get access to more things that you can also buy to boost cookie production.

I'm making hundreds of cookies every second!

## Day 2

I can't believe I'm still playing this game. I'm making nearly 200M cookies per second and still want to make them faster. I've already bought one of everything and now have to buy 50 of everything. Why?

## Day 3

I'm making billions of cookies a day and have just unlocked the Grandmapocalypse. I think that helps me get more cookies. Why?

## Day 4

Why?

## Day 5

Cookie?
