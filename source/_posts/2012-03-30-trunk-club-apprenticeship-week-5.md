It’s long, comprehensive and will probably need to be adjusted, but I see it as a great list of things to know about and a mid- to long-term list of goals.
In other news, we selected GeckoBoard for the front-end of the dashboards, and Code Academy had another great demo day on Wednesday.
Next week: launching Trunk Club’s dashboards hopefully!
